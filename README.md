# Trip-Split-UI

Trip Split
Pitch: Tired of paying for a friends uber ride or lunch while on vacation and never getting paid back? Trip split saves the day by keeping track and telling each person they owe money.

MVP: Onboarding process for a new user to create a profile. Ability to create a trip, including number of people on the trip, names of people on the trip, destination, and dates. Ability to edit or delete this information. Ability to create a trip expense item title, price, who paid for it, number of people that paid for it, and names of people that paid for it.
Ability to ‘close’ trip and total it out. Ability to view a trip summary page that gives a final total that each person owes or is owed (look at the total trip expenses, divide by the total number of people, and balance that with the total amount each person already paid). Homepage to see list of current or past trips.

Stretch: Ability to add friends, and select a friends profile when adding trip members. Ability to add pictures to user profile. Ability for multiple users to be connected to and editing the same trip (viewing total trip expenses, even if added by another user). Connect venmo so each person can repay their friends.
